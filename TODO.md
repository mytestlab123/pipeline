# TODO - Nextflow Offline Execution Demo

## MVP Core Deliverables
- [ ] **online-prepare.sh** - Script for downloading pipeline assets on online machine
- [ ] **generate-image-list.sh** - Script for generating list of required Docker images
- [ ] **pull-images.sh** - Script for pulling Docker images and saving to shared location
- [ ] **offline-setup.sh** - Script for loading assets on offline machine
- [ ] **run-offline-pipeline.sh** - Script for running pipeline with offline flag

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Support for multiple nf-core pipelines beyond demo
- [ ] Integration with AWS Systems Manager for offline communication
- [ ] Automated image optimization and compression
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and logging
- [ ] Support for custom Nextflow workflows
- [ ] Integration with AWS Batch for scalable execution

## Known Limitations
- **Internet Dependency**: Requires initial online phase for asset download
- **Storage Requirements**: Docker images can be large (multi-GB)
- **Pipeline Specific**: Currently focused on nf-core/demo pipeline
- **Manual Process**: No automated pipeline for end-to-end execution

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling to all scripts
- [ ] Implement logging framework
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Create configuration management system
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations

## Documentation Gaps
- [ ] Complete architecture diagrams
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create user manual with step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking guide

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for individual script functions
- [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end workflow
- [ ] Performance tests for large pipelines
- [ ] Security tests for file handling

## Infrastructure Considerations
- [ ] AWS IAM roles and policies documentation
- [ ] S3 bucket configuration and lifecycle policies
- [ ] EC2 instance sizing recommendations
- [ ] Network security group configurations
