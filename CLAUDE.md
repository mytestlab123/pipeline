# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Nextflow Offline Execution Demo - MVP that enables running nf-core pipelines on AWS EC2 instances without internet access. The project implements a two-phase workflow: online preparation and offline execution.

## Core Architecture

### Two-Phase Workflow System
The project follows a strict separation between online and offline phases:

**Online Phase (Internet-connected machine):**
- Downloads nf-core/demo pipeline assets from GitLab
- Scans pipeline configuration to generate required Docker image lists
- Pulls Docker images and saves to shared storage (S3 or Docker Hub)

**Offline Phase (Private subnet, no internet):**
- Loads pre-downloaded assets from shared storage
- Loads Docker images from shared location
- Executes pipeline with `-offline` flag

### Key Components
- **Shell Scripts**: Primary automation layer (5 core scripts)
- **Docker/Podman**: Container runtime (constraint: prefer podman)
- **Nextflow**: Workflow management system
- **nf-core**: Pipeline framework targeting nf-core/demo initially

## Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests with /tmp framework (recommended)
./test/run-all-tests.sh

# Run environment smoke test only
./test/smoke-test.sh

# Run legacy test suite
./test/run.sh

# Validate test criteria
./test/validate-test-criteria.sh
```

### MVP Development Workflow
The project follows a structured MVP approach with 5 core deliverables:

1. **online-prepare.sh** - Downloads pipeline assets on online machine
2. **generate-image-list.sh** - Generates list of required Docker images
3. **pull-images.sh** - Pulls Docker images and saves to shared location
4. **offline-setup.sh** - Loads assets on offline machine
5. **run-offline-pipeline.sh** - Runs pipeline with offline flag

## Technology Constraints

### Required Tools
- Linux/Shell Script environment
- podman (preferred over docker)
- Nextflow installation
- AWS CLI (for S3 access)

### Target Environment
- AWS Cloud9 (Amazon Linux 2) for development
- EC2 instances for online/offline phases
- S3 buckets for asset storage
- Docker Hub (mytestlab123 organization) for image hosting

## Key Implementation Details

### Target Pipeline
Initially focused on nf-core/demo (version 1.0.2) as the reference implementation:
- Repository: https://github.com/nf-core/demo/tree/1.0.2
- Documentation: https://nf-co.re/demo/1.0.2/
- Offline docs: https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/offline

### Asset Storage Strategy
Two approaches supported:
1. **S3 Bucket**: Shared storage for both pipeline assets and Docker images
2. **Docker Hub**: Push/pull model using mytestlab123 organization account

### Known Limitations
- Internet dependency for initial online phase
- Large storage requirements for Docker images (multi-GB)
- Currently pipeline-specific (nf-core/demo focus)
- Manual process with no automated end-to-end pipeline

## Development Timeline
- **MVP Target**: 2 hours for demo
- **Developer Estimate**: 30 minutes using shell scripts and nf-core/demo
- **Current Status**: ✅ **MVP COMPLETE** - All 5 scripts implemented, simplified, and tested (Ready for demo)

## Issue Tracking
All issues tracked in `issues.md` file (not GitHub issues). MVP scope defined in GitHub issue #1 and draft PR #2.

## Future Enhancements
Post-MVP considerations include multiple pipeline support, AWS Systems Manager integration, automated image optimization, and AWS Batch integration. See TODO.md for comprehensive future work list.
